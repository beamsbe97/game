Currently only compatible on Linux. Still learning how to manage C++ dependencies.\
Make sure to have a compiler that can support C++ 17 and above

1. Make the compile script executable
```
chmod +x compile.sh
```

2. Execute the compile script
```
./compile.sh
```

3. Launch the game
```
bin/main.exe
```
